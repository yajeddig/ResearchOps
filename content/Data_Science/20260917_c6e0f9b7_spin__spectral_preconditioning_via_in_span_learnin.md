## SPIN — Spectral Preconditioning via IN-span learning

SPIN is a lightweight, modular Python framework for **online adaptive, hyper-reduced reduced-order modeling (ROM)** of time-dependent nonlinear PDEs. It introduces **in-span learning**: a reduced model can adapt not only from external corrections, but also from the trajectory it has _already produced itself_. Streaming the ROM's own in-span predictions through an **incremental SVD (iSVD) with forgetting** reweights and rotates the basis inside the current subspace, preparing it to absorb the next external correction far more effectively. The projection is a **Least-Squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG)** ROM with QDEIM hyper-reduction.

This is the companion code to our paper:

## The idea

A reduced-order model compresses an expensive high-dimensional simulation into a small subspace and evolves only a few coordinates inside it — fast, but it loses accuracy once the dynamics drift beyond the training data.

**Adaptive ROMs** fix this by updating the subspace online using _external_ information — an occasional full-order solve or sensor snapshot. Such information lies **outside** the current subspace, so we call it **out-of-span**. This is the standard, state-of-the-art recipe (our _baseline adaptive ROM_).

Between those external corrections, the ROM constantly produces predictions of its own. By construction these lie **inside** the current subspace — they are **in-span** — so the usual subspace-update view discards them. We show that is wrong: streamed through an iSVD with forgetting, the ROM's own in-span predictions **rotate and reweight the basis inside the subspace**. They don't move the subspace; they change how it is _prepared_ to absorb the next external correction.

```
baseline adaptive ROM:   predict ─ predict ─ predict ─ CORRECT ─ predict ─ ...
                                                            ▲ external (out-of-span)

  SPIN ROM:                predict ─ in-span ─ in-span ─ CORRECT ─ in-span ─ ...
                                        ▲ learn from        ▲ same external correction,
                                          own output          but absorbed better
```

**SPIN is exactly the baseline adaptive ROM, plus an in-span update between every pair of external corrections** — same correction budget, no extra full-order solves, just more use of information the model already generated.

> SPIN's out-of-span channel (the baseline adaptive ROM we compare against) is itself a strong, recent method — see our previous work, [arXiv:2605.28684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.28684). SPIN adds the in-span channel on top of it.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/SPIN.git
cd SPIN
pip install -e .
```

Python ≥ 3.9 with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib (see [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/APHedayat/SPIN/blob/main/requirements.txt)). The demo notebooks also need Jupyter:

```bash
pip install -e ".[notebooks]"
```

* * *

## Quick start

```python
from spin.core import compute_pod_basis, qdeim
from spin.problems.burgers import BurgersSolver, BurgersSpinROM
from spin.diagnostics import relative_l2_error

# 1) Run the FOM to get training + reference snapshots.
fom = BurgersSolver(Nx=256, L=1.0, nu=1e-2, dt=1e-3)
snaps = fom.simulate(fom.initial_condition(), n_steps=500, tol=1e-8)  # (Nx, 501)

# 2) Offline basis + QDEIM indices from a handful of early snapshots.
Phi, sigma = compute_pod_basis(snaps[:, :4], r=4)
p_inds = qdeim(Phi, n_sensors=4)
a0 = Phi.T @ snaps[:, 0]

# 3) The same driver gives all three models via `mode`.
def run(mode, gamma_in=1.0, gamma_out=0.25):
    rom = BurgersSpinROM(Phi.copy(), sigma.copy(), p_inds.copy(),
                         dt=1e-3, nu=1e-2, dx=fom.dx, zs=10,
                         mode=mode, gamma_in=gamma_in, gamma_out=gamma_out)
    return rom.simulate(a0.copy(), n_steps=500)

baseline = run("baseline", gamma_out=0.01)
spin     = run("spin",     gamma_in=1.0, gamma_out=0.25)

print("baseline adaptive:", relative_l2_error(baseline, snaps).mean())  # ~5.5e-2
print("SPIN :", relative_l2_error(spin,     snaps).mean())  # ~1.9e-2
```

The only thing that changes between the two runs is `mode`:

| `mode` | in-span updates | out-of-span corrections | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `"static"` | ✗ | ✗ | fixed POD basis, no adaptation |
| `"baseline"` | ✗ | ✓ | baseline adaptive ROM (state-of-the-art) |
| `"spin"` | ✓ | ✓ | **SPIN** (this work) |

**Key knobs:**`zs` (how often an out-of-span correction is taken), `gamma_out` (out-of-span forgetting), `gamma_in` (in-span forgetting — the memory horizon of in-span learning).

See [`examples/`](https://github.com/APHedayat/SPIN/blob/main/examples) for fully worked, runnable notebooks.

## The method, in one picture

Every `zs` steps, SPIN performs a single full-order operator query to obtain a correction snapshot; this **out-of-span** signal updates the basis via iSVD (forgetting `gamma_out`), then the QDEIM indices are refreshed. On _every other_ step, SPIN instead feeds the ROM's **own prediction** through the same iSVD (forgetting `gamma_in`) — an **in-span** update that rotates and reweights the basis without moving the subspace. The full procedure is Algorithm 1 in the paper.

The **core** modules are entirely problem-agnostic and reusable across equations. The **problems** modules are concrete templates showing how to couple a specific equation's hyper-reduced residual and Jacobian to the core machinery.

## Bringing SPIN to your own equation

> **Worked template:**[`examples/04_custom_equation.ipynb`](https://github.com/APHedayat/SPIN/blob/main/examples/04_custom_equation.ipynb) walks through this end to end on a brand-new equation (the 1D heat equation), from FOM to a running static / baseline / SPIN comparison. Start there if you want a copy-paste starting point.

All problem-specific code lives behind two methods. To run SPIN on a new equation you only need to:

1.   **Provide a FOM solver** exposing a `.step(u, tol, max_iter, verbose) -> u_new` method that advances your full state by one time step (for the out-of-span correction query). Any implicit solver you already have will do.
2.   **Subclass `SpinROMBase`** (via a small mixin, as the reference problems do) and implement: 
    *   `residual_sample(self, a, a_old) -> (m,) ndarray` — the LSPG residual at the sampling indices `self.p_inds`, evaluated at `u = self.Phi @ a`;
    *   `jacobian_sample(self, a) -> (m, r) ndarray` — the corresponding sampled LSPG test operator `W = d(residual)/da`.

```python
import numpy as np
from spin.core.adaptive_rom import SpinROMBase

class MyEquationSpinROM(SpinROMBase):
    def residual_sample(self, a, a_old):
        u = self.Phi @ a
        # ... evaluate your sampled spatial operator F at rows self.p_inds ...
        return self._Phi_p @ (a - a_old) + self.dt * Fp

    def jacobian_sample(self, a):
        u = self.Phi @ a
        # ... rows of d(residual)/da at the sample points ...
        return self._Phi_p + self.dt * JfPhi   # (m, r)
```

The base class provides the cached sampling data you need inside these hooks: `self._Phi_p`, `self._Phi_up`, `self._Phi_down` (the basis at the sample points and their periodic neighbours), `self.p_inds`, and `self.M` (the QDEIM pseudoinverse), all refreshed automatically after every adaptation event. Then:

```python
rom = MyEquationSpinROM(
    Phi=Phi, sigma=sigma, p_inds=p_inds, dt=dt,
    fom_solver=my_fom, zs=10,
    mode="spin", gamma_in=1.0, gamma_out=0.25,
)
u_pred = rom.simulate(a0, n_steps=500)   # (N, n_steps+1)
```

`src/spin/problems/burgers/rom.py` and `src/spin/problems/fisher_kpp/rom.py` are concrete, commented templates demonstrating both hooks in practice (including the static ROM via `LSPGROMBase`).

## Reproducing the paper

Open the notebooks in [`examples/`](https://github.com/APHedayat/SPIN/blob/main/examples) and run them top to bottom. Each one has all of its control variables in a single cell near the top, so you can immediately change the rank, correction interval, or forgetting factors and see the effect. With the default values they reproduce the main-text results:

| experiment | static | baseline adaptive | SPIN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Burgers** (mean rel. $L_{2}$) | 3.7e-1 | 5.5e-2 | **1.9e-2** |
| **Fisher-KPP** (mean rel. $L_{2}$) | 2.1e-1 | 1.2e-1 | **7.8e-3** |

For the spiral, the notebook reproduces the reported residual capture (0.26 → 0.80), plane-change angle (15° → 53°), and correction error (1.0e-2 → 8.8e-4) when in-span preconditioning is enabled.

## 💡 Key Insights
- SPIN is a Python framework for online adaptive, hyper-reduced Reduced-Order Modeling (ROM) of time-dependent nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
- It introduces 'in-span learning', allowing ROMs to adapt from their own predictions, not just external corrections, by reweighting and rotating the basis within the current subspace.
- The adaptation mechanism uses an incremental SVD (iSVD) with forgetting for both in-span and out-of-span updates, and the projection is a Least-Squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) ROM with QDEIM hyper-reduction.
- SPIN significantly improves accuracy compared to baseline adaptive ROMs using the same correction budget, as demonstrated on Burgers and Fisher-KPP equations.
- The framework is modular, offering problem-agnostic core components and clear templates for integrating custom Full-Order Model (FOM) solvers and equation-specific residuals/Jacobians.
