## 🎯 Relevance
This content is highly relevant for process engineers and industrial data scientists as it discusses the fundamental shift in industrial automation control systems from hardware-centric to software-defined. Understanding this evolution is crucial for designing, implementing, and integrating modern IT/OT solutions, optimizing processes with advanced control, and preparing for future industrial architectures involving AI and advanced software development practices. It highlights the ROI of moving away from legacy hardware and the strategic implications of vendor choices.

## 📖 Content
Ok we can finally close the discussion on whether vPLC's or virtual controllers are the future of industrial process automation. If Emerson thinks it's good enough for their customers, then it's good enough for you.

Their Delta-V system is one of the default choices for many pharma, chemical, food ingredients and other process plants.

That new Tesla refining plant? Probably running Delta-V based on the recruitment requirements.

Soon almost all major vendors will have software controllers. If you still plan to install hardware controllers then you know that it will soon already be legacy.

A couple of notes though:

First of all the one side of the SDA coin is the decoupling of the runtimes from the hardware. This still doesn't fully do that. It looks it will need dedicated Emerson-branded Dell servers. Emerson is also the only DCS vendor that has dropped out of OPA (Open Process Automation). One of their arguments is that everything can fit better if it comes from one vendor.
If you look at the video it indeed looks very smooth. It does come at the cost of openness and choice of system integrator. Know what you get yourself into for the next couple of decades.

The other side of the SDA coin is the control-logic also becoming defined as modern software. Think of integration with git, code generation, collaboration with modern AI agents, .... Delta-V still has a long way to go there. But so do the other DSC vendors ...

Anyway, a very welcome evolution!

DeltaV IQ Controller - The Future of Control Is Software Defined
Discover Emerson's DeltaV™ IQ Controller - the most flexible automation architecture DeltaV has ever delivered. By removing traditional hardware constraints, the IQ Contr...

## 💡 Key Insights
- Virtual PLCs and software-defined controllers are becoming the standard in industrial process automation, as evidenced by major vendors like Emerson.
- Emerson's DeltaV IQ Controller represents a move towards decoupling control runtimes from hardware, though it still relies on dedicated vendor-specific servers.
- The shift to software-defined control involves modern software development practices (Git, code generation) and potential integration with AI agents.
- While offering benefits, Emerson's approach (single-vendor solution, departure from OPA) may impact system openness and choice of integrators.
- Traditional hardware controllers are rapidly becoming legacy technology.
