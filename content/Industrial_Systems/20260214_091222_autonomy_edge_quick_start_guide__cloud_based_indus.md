Quick Start Guide
-----------------

This guide walks you through creating your first automation project on the Autonomy Edge platform, from setting up your environment to deploying a simple blinking output program to a virtual PLC.

Understanding Autonomy Edge
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Autonomy Edge is a cloud-based platform for industrial automation that brings modern software development practices to PLC programming. Instead of requiring specialized hardware and proprietary software installations, Autonomy Edge lets you develop, deploy, and manage automation programs entirely from your web browser.

### Why Autonomy Edge?

Traditional PLC development requires expensive hardware, proprietary software licenses, and physical access to devices. Autonomy Edge removes these barriers by providing:

*   **Browser-Based Development**: Write PLC programs using industry-standard IEC 61131-3 languages without installing any software
*   **Virtual PLCs**: Deploy automation logic to physical devices (PLCs, PACs, Industrial PCs, Servers) running in containerized runtime instances in real-time
*   **Remote Management**: Deploy programs and monitor devices from anywhere with an internet connection (internet is only required for management, not for running control logic)
*   **Cloud Collaboration**: Share projects with team members and maintain version history automatically

### Platform Architecture

The Autonomy Edge ecosystem consists of four key components that work together:

**Autonomy Edge Platform**: The cloud-based web application where you manage projects, users, and devices. It includes the browser-based OpenPLC Editor IDE for writing automation programs.

**Orchestrator**: An agent that runs on an edge device (like a linux-based PLC, PAC, industrial PC, or on-prem server) and manages your vPLC instances. It maintains a secure connection to the cloud and handles container orchestration, networking, and system monitoring.

**vPLC (Virtual PLC)**: A containerized instance of OpenPLC Runtime v4 that executes your automation programs. Each vPLC runs independently and can communicate with physical devices through industrial protocols like Modbus, EtherCAT, or EtherNet/IP.

**Physical I/O and Devices**: The sensors, actuators, remote I/O modules, HMIs, and other industrial equipment that connect to your vPLCs through industrial protocols like Modbus TCP/IP, Modbus RTU, EtherCAT, or EtherNet/IP.

### IEC 61131-3 Programming

Autonomy Edge supports all five standard IEC 61131-3 programming languages:

| Language | Type | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structured Text (ST)** | Textual | Complex algorithms, calculations, data processing |
| **Ladder Diagram (LD)** | Graphical | Discrete logic, familiar to electricians |
| **Function Block Diagram (FBD)** | Graphical | Process control, signal flow visualization |
| **Instruction List (IL)** | Textual | Low-level control, legacy system migration |
| **Sequential Function Chart (SFC)** | Graphical | State machines, sequential processes |

Additionally, you can extend functionality with **Python** and **C++** function blocks for advanced use cases like machine learning integration or custom protocol handlers.

What You'll Build
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this guide, you'll create a complete automation workflow from scratch:

1.  **Set up infrastructure**: Install the orchestrator agent on your device and provision a vPLC instance
2.  **Develop a program**: Write a "Hello World" blinking output program in Structured Text
3.  **Configure communication**: Set up Modbus TCP/IP to expose your outputs to external devices
4.  **Deploy and run**: Compile and upload your program to the vPLC

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Autonomy Edge account**: Sign up at [edge.autonomylogic.com](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/) if you haven't already
*   **Modern web browser**: Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended for the best experience
*   **Linux device**: Any Linux-based device where you have SSH or terminal access (PLC, PAC, Industrial PC, Server, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
*   **Modbus slave device**: A remote I/O module or device with at least one digital output that supports Modbus TCP/IP. This will receive the blinking output signal from your program.

* * *

Step 1: Set Up an Orchestrator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An orchestrator is an edge agent that manages your vPLC devices. It runs on your physical hardware and maintains a secure connection to the Autonomy Edge cloud.

### 1.1 Start the New Orchestrator Wizard

1.  Log in to the Autonomy Edge platform at [edge.autonomylogic.com](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/)
2.  Navigate to **Orchestrators** in the left sidebar
3.  Click the **Add Orchestrator** button

![Image 1: New Orchestrator wizard - Details step](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/platform-features/orchestrator-management/images/add-orchestrator-step1.png)

### 1.2 Enter Orchestrator Details

1.  Enter a name for your orchestrator (e.g., "QuickStartOrchestrator")
2.  Optionally add a description
3.  Click **Next** to proceed to the Install step

### 1.3 Install the Agent on Your Device

The wizard provides a curl command to install the orchestrator agent on your Linux device.

![Image 2: New Orchestrator wizard - Install step](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/platform-features/orchestrator-management/images/add-orchestrator-step2.png)

1.  Click **Copy** to copy the installation command
2.  Open a terminal on your Linux device (via SSH or directly)
3.  Paste and run the command: `curl https://getedge.me | bash`
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation
5.  When the installation completes, the agent will display an **Orchestrator ID**

### 1.4 Link the Orchestrator

After installation, the agent generates an ID that you need to enter in the platform.

![Image 3: New Orchestrator wizard - Link step](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/platform-features/orchestrator-management/images/add-orchestrator-step3.png)

1.  Copy the **Orchestrator ID** from your terminal
2.  Paste it into the **ID Orchestrator** field
3.  Click **Create Orchestrator**

> **Note:** The orchestrator ID expires after 5 minutes. If it expires, run the installation command again to generate a new ID.

Once linked, your orchestrator will appear in the list with its connection status.

![Image 4: Orchestrators list showing connected orchestrator](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/platform-features/orchestrator-management/images/orchestrators-list.png)

* * *

Step 2: Create a vPLC Device
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A vPLC (virtual PLC) is a containerized runtime that executes your automation programs. One of the key advantages of Autonomy Edge is the ability to run multiple vPLC instances on a single physical device. Each vPLC runs in complete isolation with real-time execution, and appears on the network with its own IP address as if it were an independent physical PLC. This allows you to maximize hardware utilization—especially on modern multicore PLCs, PACs, and industrial PCs that are often underutilized when running traditional single-threaded PLC runtimes.

1.  Click on your orchestrator to open its details
2.  Navigate to the **Devices** tab
3.  Click **Add Device**

![Image 5: Add New Device dialog](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/platform-features/vplc-management/images/add-device-modal.png)

1.  Enter a device name (e.g., "Demo vPLC")
2.  Configure the network settings:
    *   A default virtual NIC (veth0) is created automatically with DHCP
    *   Click on the NIC to configure static IP if needed

3.  Click **Create** to provision the vPLC

The vPLC will start automatically and show a "success" status when ready.

![Image 6: Devices list showing the created vPLC](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/platform-features/vplc-management/images/devices-list-with-vplc.png)

* * *

Step 3: Create a New Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's create a project for our blinking output program.

1.  Navigate to **Projects** in the left sidebar
2.  Click **New Project**
3.  Enter a project name (e.g., "BlinkingOutput")
4.  Select **Structured Text** as the programming language
5.  Click **Create**

The project will open in the OpenPLC Editor IDE.

![Image 7: OpenPLC Editor IDE with new project](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/blank-editor.png)

* * *

Step 4: Declare Variables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the IDE, you'll see the variables table at the top and the program editor below. We need two variables:

1.  A timer to control the blink interval
2.  An output variable to toggle

### Add the Timer Variable

1.  Click the **+** button in the variables table toolbar to add a new row
2.  Set the following values:
    *   **Name**: `blink_timer`
    *   **Class**: Local
    *   **Type**: TON (search for "TON" in the type dropdown under System)

### Add the Output Variable

1.  Click **+** again to add another variable
2.  Set the following values:
    *   **Name**: `output_state`
    *   **Class**: Output
    *   **Type**: BOOL (found under Base Type)
    *   **Location**: `%QX0.0`

The **Location** field is critical - it maps your program variable to the physical I/O address. The `%QX0.0` address corresponds to the first digital output coil, which we'll configure to communicate via Modbus in Step 6.

> **Understanding Located Variables**: In IEC 61131-3, the `%Q` prefix indicates an output, `X` indicates a bit (boolean), and `0.0` is the address (byte 0, bit 0). This creates a direct link between your program variable and the Modbus coil address.

* * *

Step 5: Write the Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 8: Variables and program code](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/program.png)

Click in the program editor area (below the variables table) and enter the following Structured Text code:

```iecst
PROGRAM BlinkingOutput
VAR
    blink_timer: TON;
    output_state: BOOL AT %QX0.0;
END_VAR

blink_timer(IN := NOT blink_timer.Q, PT := T#500ms);

IF blink_timer.Q THEN
    output_state := NOT output_state;
END_IF;
```

This program:

*   Uses a TON timer that triggers every 500ms
*   Toggles the `output_state` each time the timer completes
*   Creates a 1-second blink cycle (500ms on, 500ms off)

Press **Cmd+S** (Mac) or **Ctrl+S** (Windows) to save your project.

* * *

Step 6: Configure Remote I/O (Modbus)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To connect your program outputs to external devices, we'll configure a Modbus Remote Device.

### Add a Remote Device

1.  Click the blue **+** button in the left sidebar
2.  Select **Remote Device** from the dropdown menu
3.  Enter a device name (e.g., "ModbusCoils")
4.  Select **Modbus** as the protocol
5.  Click **Create**

![Image 9: Add Remote Device dialog](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/add-remote-device.png)

The Remote Device configuration panel will open:

![Image 10: Remote Device configuration panel](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/configure-remote-device.png)

Configure the connection settings:

*   **Transport**: Select TCP/IP for network communication (or RTU for serial)
*   **IP Address**: Enter the IP address of your Modbus slave device (e.g., `192.168.1.100`). The device must be accessible on the same network where the vPLC was configured.
*   **Port**: Default is `502` (standard Modbus TCP port)
*   **Timeout (ms)**: Response timeout in milliseconds (default `1000`)
*   **Slave ID**: The Modbus slave/unit identifier (default `1`)

### Add an IO Group

1.  In the **IO Tag Mapping** section, click the **+** button
2.  Configure the IO Group:
    *   **Name**: BlinkCoils
    *   **Function Code**: Write Multiple Coils (FC 15)
    *   **Cycle Time (ms)**: 100
    *   **Offset**: 0
    *   **Length**: 8
    *   **Error Handling**: Keep last value

3.  Click **Create**

![Image 11: New IO Group dialog](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/add-io-group.png)

The IO Group will appear in the table. Click the expand arrow to see individual coil mappings:

![Image 12: IO Group expanded showing coil mappings](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/expand-io-group.png)

The table shows:

*   **BlinkCoils** (parent): Digital Output (Multiple Coils), Address `%QX0.0`, Function Code Write Multiple Coils (FC 15)
*   **BlinkCoils_0** through **BlinkCoils_7**: Individual coils mapped to `%QX0.0` through `%QX0.7`

This configuration maps 8 digital outputs starting at address `%QX0.0` to Modbus coils. Since our `output_state` variable is located at `%QX0.0`, it will be automatically written to the Modbus device whenever its value changes.

* * *

Step 7: Connect to the vPLC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's connect to the vPLC to deploy your program.

1.  In the IDE, expand **Devices** in the left sidebar
2.  Click on **Orchestrators** to open the Device Orchestrators panel
3.  Expand your orchestrator (e.g., "QuickStartOrchestrator") to see your vPLC
4.  Click on your vPLC (e.g., "Demo vPLC") to select it (it should show "Running" status)
5.  Click the **Connect** button

### First-Time User Setup

When connecting to a new vPLC for the first time, you'll need to create an OpenPLC Runtime user account. This account is separate from your Autonomy Edge platform account and is used to authenticate with the PLC runtime.

![Image 13: Create First User dialog](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/first-login-runtime.png)

1.  The **Create First User** dialog will appear
2.  Enter a username (e.g., "admin")
3.  Enter a password and confirm it
4.  Click **Create User**

> **Note:** If users have already been created on this vPLC, you'll see a login dialog instead. Enter your OpenPLC Runtime credentials to connect.

Once connected, the vPLC status will show both "Running" and "Connected", and the PLC Status will show "EMPTY" (no program loaded yet).

![Image 14: vPLC showing Connected status](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/first-connect-runtime.png)

* * *

Step 8: Compile and Deploy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After connecting to the vPLC:

1.  Click the **Download** button in the left sidebar (folder icon with a down arrow) to compile and deploy your program
2.  Check the Console panel at the bottom for compilation progress
3.  If compilation succeeds, the program will be uploaded automatically
4.  The PLC Status will change to "RUNNING" when the program is active

![Image 15: Program running with Scan Cycle Statistics](https://edge.autonomylogic.com/docs/getting-started/images/runtime-running.png)

The Scan Cycle Statistics panel shows real-time performance metrics:

*   **Scan Count**: Number of program cycles executed
*   **Overruns**: Cycles that exceeded the target time (should be 0)
*   **Scan Time (avg)**: Average execution time per cycle
*   **Cycle Time (avg)**: Time between scan starts
*   **Cycle Latency (avg)**: Scheduling delay

* * *

Verifying Your Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once deployed, your blinking output program is running on the vPLC. You can verify this by:

*   Watching the Scan Count increment in the Scan Cycle Statistics
*   Check the output coils of your Modbus slave device
*   Checking the PLC Logs tab for runtime messages

* * *
