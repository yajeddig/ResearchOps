### 🎯 Relevance
This article provides a practical framework and strategic guidance for industrial companies to effectively plan, implement, and manage Industry 4.0 technologies. It helps in making informed decisions about automation and augmentation investments, optimizing processes, and achieving better ROI by addressing common pitfalls and promoting a human-centric approach to digital transformation.

### 📝 Summary
- **Key message:** This article demystifies Industry 4.0 by introducing a framework that categorizes technologies into point/system automation and point/system augmentation, guiding manufacturing managers on how to strategically pursue digital transformation beyond the utopian 'lights-out factory' vision.
- **Data/Statistics mentioned:** The Global Lighthouse Network report mentions over 1000 different use cases. Various companies (ABB, Audi, Bosch, Renault, Siemens, Fanuc, GE, Tesla, IKEA, IBM, Red Bull Racing, Lindt & Sprüngli) and initiatives (Hanover Messe, World Economic Forum, European Commission Industry 5.0) are cited as examples of Industry 4.0 adoption and challenges.
- **Insights:** The initial vision of Industry 4.0 as complete system automation often devolves into managing disparate point solutions. A more effective strategy involves a balanced portfolio of use cases across automation and augmentation, with an initial focus on point augmentation to support human workers and foster ingenuity.
- **Actionable takeaways:** Companies should utilize the proposed framework to map and prioritize Industry 4.0 technologies, focusing on use cases with clear business value. It is crucial to build and maintain a robust enabling digital infrastructure while strategically adopting point augmentation first to ensure employee buy-in and incremental progress towards broader system integration.

### 📄 Extracted Content
Abstract-If there was a use-to-talk ratio for Industry 4.0, the score would be sobering—not because companies are not getting results but because most are a world apart from the engineering vision of a fully automatic factory. One plausible reason for the disappointing uptake is that manufacturing managers are confused about what Industry 4.0 is and what it can deliver for bottom-line performance. It is not surprising; every new hype is surrounded by the promise of newfound land, gloomy visions, and disappointing results. This article reviews the progress toward automatic lights-out factories and presents a simple matrix to help demystify Industry 4.0 and how to pursue it.
Key words: Augmentation, automation, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, manufacturing.
A framework spanning out automation versus augmentation on a horizontal axis and point solutions versus system solutions on a vertical axis, as shown in Figure 1, can help demystify Industry 4.0.
First, there is a foundational layer of enabling digital technologies (see bottom of Figure 2) that collect, transmit, store, and protect data (e.g., [26]). These technologies have no use case on their own but enable the potential of other technologies.
Point automation technologies remove humans from process steps.
Point augmentation technologies assist workers in doing their work better, faster, or cheaper.
System automation (i.e., true Industry 4.0) is more realistically realized when there is an orchestrated use of many point automation technologies.
System augmentation... hosts technologies that aim to improve cross-process tasks, such as control tower technologies, supply chain software, and more traditional business management software, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and manufacturing execution systems (MES).
However, in the early stages of a transformation, focusing considerable efforts on point augmentation is a better strategy. Why? Because using new technologies to help people succeed at their job tasks rather than making them obsolete is not only good for morale but also frees up human ingenuity for the next improvement.
Companies that pursue a strategically selected and well-balanced portfolio of use cases from all four quadrants may be best positioned to reap exponential business benefits.
