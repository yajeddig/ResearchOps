## 🎯 Relevance
This software is highly useful for process engineers and industrial data scientists as it provides an accessible tool for simulating fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and mass transfer in industrial processes. It can be used for designing and optimizing equipment (e.g., reactors, mixers, heat exchangers), analyzing process performance, and troubleshooting operational issues, thereby reducing the need for costly physical prototypes and experiments. Its open-source nature and GUI make advanced simulation techniques more approachable for learning and practical application.

## 📖 Content
BARAM is a Free Open Source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software package developed by NEXTFOAM. Its primary goal is to mitigate the steep learning curve associated with traditional text-based CFD solvers by providing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). BARAM integrates modified OpenFOAM® solvers, making advanced CFD simulations more accessible to a wider audience.

Key features and components suggested by the repository structure include:
- `PyFoam`: Likely integration or utility scripts related to OpenFOAM.
- `baramFlow`: Suggests the core flow simulation application.
- `baramMesh`: Indicates functionality for mesh generation, a critical step in CFD.
- `libbaram`: A core library for BARAM functionalities.
- `widgets`: Implies GUI components for the user interface.

BARAM is released under the GNU Public License (GPL).
