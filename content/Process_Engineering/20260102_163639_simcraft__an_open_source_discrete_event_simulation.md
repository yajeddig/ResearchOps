I've finally achieved one of my long-term goals during this holiday season: the launch of SimCraft, an open-source Discrete Event Simulation (DES) framework for Python.

Building a production-grade simulation engine has been a journey of merging years of research. I designed SimCraft to bridge the gap between traditional industrial modeling and modern Al (Reinforcement Learning).

Why SimCraft? While established tools (SimPy, Salabim etc.) exist, I found a need for a framework that handles Hierarchical Composition (building complex systems from nested, modular components) while offering a native, "plug-and-play" interface for Al.

Key Features:
-Nest simulations within simulations-all sharing a single, high-performance clock.
-Gym-compatible interfaces and Multi-Agent RL support are built into the core.
-Uses Welford's algorithm for online statistics and time-weighted monitoring.
-Optimized event scheduling capable of ~475k+ events/ sec.
-Advanced handling for multi-server stations, priority queues, and preemptive resources.

For me this project is more than just code; it's a commitment to making advanced simulation-optimization more accessible to the research community and industry professionals alike. Links are in the comments.

I am looking forward to seeing how the community uses SimCraft to build the next generation of Digital Twins and Al-driven systems. If you're interested in simulation or RL, let's connect!
